Used ChatGPT to: 

1. Add light / dark mode to UI and change text input area to scale with window size
   1. ChatGPT rewrote DialogBox and MainWindow classes and fxml files, and wrote styles.css.

2. Generate background images

3. Write user guide

Notes on effectiveness:
1. More often than not code generated by ChatGPT was not compatible to be directly inserted into the codebase.
2. Better quality answers were given when complex tasks are broken into smaller parts and context is provided.
3. Reviewing and refining generated code was necessary.
4. Overall the process fixing slightly incompatible boilerplate code is still faster than hand coding,
